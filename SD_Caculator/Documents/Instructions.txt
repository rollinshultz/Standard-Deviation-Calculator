--The Standard Deviation Calculator--

There are two ways to use this calculator.
1. You can enter the dataset manually
one number at a time. Enter a number in the textbox next to the ADD button. 
when you are finished click the CALCULATE button and the results will appear
in the bottom two fields.
2. You can click the load button to select a csv file from a directory. Then as
before click the CALCULATE button and see the results below.
The app has been tested both ways. The .txt file used in the tests was of the 
form: 2,3,5,3,1,2,3 It should also work with the form: 2, 3, 5, 4, 6 where the commas are 
followed by a space.
